# Diffusion Simulation: Cellular Automata and Particles
This project implements a simulation of diffusion dynamics on a two-dimensional grid, exploring two main approaches:

Discrete Cellular Automata Diffusion (DDP): Uses a difference equation to model diffusion in a discrete medium, considering interaction with neighbors and the possibility of obstacles in the medium.

Particle Diffusion (Stochastic Simulation): Simulates the random motion of particles on the grid. Each particle has a probability of moving to one of its neighbors or staying at its current position. Multiple experiments are performed to obtain a spatial average that is compared to the DPE solution.
